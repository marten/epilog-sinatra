These are my links for May 1st:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://photographers-toolbox.com/products/jigasawrus/demo/index.html">Jigasawrus</a> - This looks sort-of like an album laid out with jQuery Masonry. I'm going to steal this layout idea for my own albums software, which I should go and write at some point.</li>
</ul>
