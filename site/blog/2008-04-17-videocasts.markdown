<em>Dear Internet,</em>

You know that screencast you're making about how Lightroom has a menu item called "Match Total Exposure" in the Settings menu in develop mode? You can just tell me that, in you know, letters and words. On screen. In a blog post. Or something.

What you don't need to do is create a video about it which requires me to pause my music, and stare at how you wobble your mouse about for a minute. I could have read that in three seconds, and have gone on with my day.

And podcasts? I like my music, thank you. I bought an iPod so I could listen to it while cycling, not so I could listen to you talking. So if there's any useful information in your podcast, please write it out too...

Thanks.
