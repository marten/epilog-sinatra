<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/touching-the-future-more-thoughts-on-the-coming-tablet-revolution">Russell Beattie on tablet computing</a>:
<blockquote><p>Someone on a laptop is usually leaning over, staring intently, clicking their mouse once in a while - all which screams "Do Not Disturb" to those around them. Someone using their mobile has almost the same sort of body language, actually! Head down, shoulders hunched, mobile held close to their eyes, squinting intently at the screen while hesitantly jabbing at various options, or suddenly tapping out a message furiously. Everyone around that person gets the clear signal that they are doing something private and to not intrude.</p>

<p>Using a tablet is completely different! You're usually sitting in a comfortable position, face viewable, eyes scanning normally, with an occasional flick at the screen or other casual movement - this gives a totally different and much more welcoming vibe.</p></blockquote>
