One big advantage - besides the quality of the light - is the attention you instantly get. Everyone wonders what the heck that weird thing on your camera is. And that's when you snap your picture. Seems to me like there's actually a photo project in there, collecting facial expressions of strangers as you shoot them up close with a ringflash.

Above image is a composite of three seperate mugshots. Shutter speeds were around 1/15th of a second at f/4. Really digging the Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8 for this kind of party stuff. An older f/4 wideangle would probably have problems focussing in dim party light, but that's no problem with this one.

I'll probably keep posting shots from this party for the next few days. Then maybe a London intermezzo from my trip there next weekend, but next week I've got a symposium and another party planned, so be ready for plenty of party shots the coming days.
